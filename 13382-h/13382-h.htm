    <h2>PREFACE.</h2>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Each of our semi-anniversaries calls for a variation in our
    thankful expressions to the public for their continued
    patronage. Yet we are prone to confess ourselves puzzled to
    ring the changes even on so pleasurable a theme as
    gratitude&mdash;although it is equally delightful to the donor
    and receiver. We will, however, persevere, to keep our
    friendship with the public in constant repair, and to gain new
    friends; for it is in the course of a periodical work as
    elsewhere in the world: "if a man does not make new
    acquaintance as he advances through life, he will soon find
    himself left alone." There is, moreover, something agreeable in
    writing a preface: it yields a second crop of pleasurable
    associations: and the brief retrospect of six months breaks up
    the <i>tedium</i> which may at some time or other be attached
    to literary pursuits. We collect the six-and-twenty sheets into
    a volume, and turn over their leaves until they almost become
    new acquaintance: some of their columns point to current
    events, and thus by a little aid of memory, make an outline
    chronology of the half-year; and, above all, if we have pleased
    the reader, we, at the same time, enjoy the self-satisfaction
    of having been employed to so gratifying an end. We like too
    the spirit of acquaintanceship which these prefacings,
    meetings, and greetings tend to keep up, although there may be
    persons who impatiently turn over a preface as the majority of
    an audience at the theatre rise to leave as soon as the last
    scene of a pantomime is shown.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The contributions of Correspondents abound in this volume.
    Their subjects belong to that class of inquiry which is useful
    and entertaining, and their research is amusing without
    dry-as-dust antiquarianism: this is a serviceable feature,
    inasmuch as it is conversational; and we know "what is said
    upon a subject is to be gathered from a hundred people." So it
    is with not a few of these communications: separately, their
    value may be small; but, collectively, they remind us of Dr.
    Johnson's quaint illustration of the many ingredients of human
    felicity: "Pound St. Paul's Church, into atoms, and consider
    any single atom; it is, to be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiv"
       id="pageiv"></a>[pg iv]</span> sure, good for nothing: but
       put all these together, and you have St. Paul's Church." A
       single article may occasionally appear trifling; but, take
       the sheet, and its bearing is obvious; and in the volume
       still more so. Our Correspondents only enjoy the reward of
       seeing their papers in print: <i>esto perpetua</i> is the
       only charm we use; and our poetical friends would gladly
       accept the <i>perpetua</i> for the</p>

    <p>of the heroines of their verse.</p>

    <p>SEVENTEEN is a promising time in life: it is redolent of
    youth, and hope, and joy; may not the context hold good in art
    and literature. Strictly speaking, we are but in our ninth
    year, although our volumes number seventeen. If we continue to
    partake as largely of the gale of public favour as hitherto, we
    shall not despair of an evergreen old age. We know the value of
    this favour, and shall strive to maintain it accordingly. It is
    to us like the Queen of Chess:</p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Sterne, who delighted in large type and blanks, would
    probably call this, as he did all life, "a mingled yarn;" and
    so we have done.</p>

    <p>The illustrious subject of this Memoir is the eldest son of
    a gentleman of small fortune, but ancient family, in
    Cumberland,<a id="footnotetag1"
       name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>
       His mother was the daughter of a Scotch clergyman; in the
       mansion of whose widow, on the Castle Hill of Edinburgh, the
       father of Lord Brougham lodged when prosecuting his studies
       at the University there. Chambers, the laborious
       topographical historian of the Modern Athens, says that Lord
       Brougham was born in St. Andrew's Square, in that city,
       though this has been disputed. The family of the late Mr.
       Brougham consisted of four sons:&mdash;Henry John, an
       extensive wine-merchant in Edinburgh, who died at Boulogne,
       about two years since; James, the Chancery Barrister, who
       formerly sat with Baron Abercromby in parliament, for
       Tregony, and sits at present for Downton, Wilts; and
       William, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pagevi"
       id="pagevi"></a>[pg vi]</span> who has recently been
       appointed a Master in Chancery, and elected Member for the
       Borough of Southwark.</p>

    <p>In early life Mr. Brougham was called to the bar of the
    Supreme Court of Edinburgh, where he practised for some time,
    and with considerable success, if we may judge from his
    frequent employment in Scotch appeals. His selection, too, on
    the part of persons charged with political offences to conduct
    their defence, would imply him to be well read in the
    institutions of his country. It was while at the Scotch Bar
    that, in conjunction with the late Mr. Francis Homer and Mr.
    Jeffrey, he planned and established the <i>Edinburgh
    Review</i>, of which he was for many years a most able and
    constant supporter. About this time also he became a member of
    the celebrated Debating Society at Edinburgh.</p>

    <p>Although professionally a lawyer, Mr. Brougham's ambition
    soon became directed to the senate; and, observes a clever
    contemporary, "it is an instructive example of the working of
    our admirable system of representation, that, up to the 16th of
    October last, Henry Brougham, the greatest orator and statesman
    that perhaps ever enlightened Parliament, was indebted for his
    seat to the patronage of a borough-holding Peer." He first took
    his seat for Camelford, a borough in the interest of the Duke
    of Bedford. In 1812, he contested Liverpool with Mr. Canning,
    and failed; and, in the same year, he was nominated for the
    Inverkeithing district of Boroughs, and failed there also. He
    was, however, subsequently returned for Winchelsea, in Sussex.
    During the discussions in parliament respecting the Princess of
    Wales, Mr. Brougham, we believe, was honoured with the
    confidence of her Royal Highness, and espoused her cause with
    much effect. His earliest efforts as a British senator were
    likewise distinguished by the same regard to the rights of
    individuals, and the liberties of the country, which he has
    uniformly manifested to the present time. Nor was he then less
    firm in opposition to what he deemed the encroachments of the
    crown, and the extravagances and abuses of the government, than
    he has since proved. His bold denial of the sovereign's right
    to the droits of the Admiralty, in 1812, will not soon be
    forgotten.</p>

    <p>In the early part of 1816, Mr. Brougham brought forward a
    motion for preserving and extending the liberty of the press,
    for which the ministers, particularly Lord Castlereagh (who
    knew well how to use "the delicious essence,") passed on him
    the highest encomiums; and miscalculating the firmness of the
    bepraised, some persons thought the minister's eulogy a lure
    for the member's vote; but the result proved that Mr. Brougham
    was above all temptation. In the same year he made a tour on
    the continent: in France he was the object of much attention;
    and he afterwards visited the residence of the Princess of
    Wales, in Italy, as was supposed, on a mission of some
    importance.</p>

    <p>In this year also, Mr. Brougham delivered two speeches in
    parliament, which are memorable for the truth of their
    prospective results. In one of them, on the treaty of the Holy
    Alliance, occurs the following almost prophetic passage: "I
    always think there is something suspicious in what a French
    writer calls, '<i>les abouchemens des rois</i>.' When crowned
    heads meet, the result of their united councils is not always
    favourable to the interest of humanity. It is not the first
    time that Austria, Russia, and Prussia have laid their heads
    together. On a former occasion, after professing a vast regard
    for truth, religion and justice, they adopted a course which
    brought such misery on their own subjects, as well as those of
    a neighbouring state&mdash;they made war against that
    unoffending country, which found little reason to felicitate
    itself on its conquerors being distinguished by Christian
    feelings. The war against Poland, and the subsequent partition
    of that devoted country, were prefaced by language very similar
    to that which this treaty contains; and the proclamation of the
    Empress Catherine, which wound up that fatal tragedy, had
    almost the very same words."&mdash;The second speech to which
    we allude was on the abuses of ancient charitable institutions.
    Speaking of schools, the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="pagevii"
       id="pagevii"></a>[pg vii]</span> funds of which were landed
       and freehold property, Mr. Brougham remarked, "In one
       instance, where the funds of the charity are £450, one boy
       only is boarded and educated. In another case, where the
       revenue of the establishment is £1,500. a year, the
       appointment of a master lying in the lord of the manor, that
       gentleman gave it to a clergyman, who out of this sum paid a
       carpenter in the village £40. for attending the school. The
       funds in the country, applicable to the education of the
       poor, cannot," he added, "be less than one hundred and fifty
       thousand pounds." The result of these and similar
       representations was the appointment of a committee to
       investigate the state of the various charities of the
       kingdom, and inquire into the application of their funds;
       from which measure great public good has already
       resulted.</p>

    <p>In 1818, Mr. Brougham was invited to become a candidate for
    the county of Westmoreland, where his family have been settled
    for the last sixty or seventy years: he could not, however,
    withstand the powerful influence of the Lowther family, and
    thus lost his election. He made another effort, at the
    dissolution of parliament, consequent upon the death of George
    III., but was again unsuccessful; and a third time in 1826.</p>

    <p>We are now approaching one of the most eventful eras of Mr.
    Brougham's parliamentary life: we mean his intrepid defence of
    the late Queen. Mr. Brougham was the first to dispatch M.
    Sicard, the old and faithful servant of the Queen, with the
    intelligence of the death of George III. The Queen immediately
    replied to Mr. Brougham, that she was determined to return to
    England; and on February 22, 1820, Mr. Brougham received from
    Lord Castlereagh an assurance that no indignity should be
    offered to her Majesty while abroad. Mr. Brougham was now
    appointed her Majesty's Attorney-General, on which occasion he
    was admitted within the bar, and assumed the silk gown, which
    was subsequently taken from him, but restored.</p>

    <p>The Queen having arrived at St. Omer, on her way to England,
    Lord Hutchinson, on the part of the King, was despatched to
    prevent, by a liberal offer, her leaving the continent. Mr.
    Brougham consented to accompany his lordship, willing to
    co-operate in the purpose yet bound by office and by friendship
    to secure for the queen the best possible terms. The Queen,
    however, was resolved, and while the deputies were exchanging
    notes, her Majesty sailed for England, and proceeded to London
    amidst all the demonstrations of popular triumph. Mr. Brougham,
    with Mr. Denman, on behalf of the Queen, next met the Duke of
    Wellington and Lord Castlereagh, on behalf of the King, to
    propose measures for an amicable arrangement, but the insertion
    of her Majesty's name in the Liturgy being refused, the
    negotiation failed. The struggle was now fast approaching. The
    notable green bag was laid on the table of the House of
    Commons, and Mr. Brougham commenced by deprecating a hasty
    discussion. The next day the minister developed the projected
    prosecutions of the government; Mr. Brougham replied, and
    concluded by demanding for the Queen a speedy and open trial.
    We need only advert to his subsequent reply to the note of Lord
    Liverpool, to the speech of Mr. Canning, and to the
    conciliatory proposition of Mr. Wilberforce. Then followed his
    speech at the bar of the House of Lords against the intended
    mode of investigation&mdash;his speech against the bill of
    Pains and Penalties&mdash;his reply to the crown counsel, and
    afterwards to the Lord Chancellor&mdash;and finally his defence
    of the Queen against the several charges. His <i>defence</i>,
    it will be remembered, lasted nearly two days, and Mr.
    Brougham, amidst profound silence, concluded one of the most
    eloquent speeches ever heard within the walls of
    parliament&mdash;with this pathetic appeal:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"My lords, I call upon you to pause. You stand on the brink
    of a precipice. You may go on in your precipitate
    career&mdash;you may pronounce against your Queen, but it will
    be the last judgment you ever will pronounce. Her persecutors
    will fail in their objects, and the ruin with which they seek
    to cover the Queen, will return to overwhelm themselves. Rescue
    the country; save the people, of whom you are the ornaments;
    but severed from whom, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageviii"
       id="pageviii"></a>[pg viii]</span> you can no more live than
       the blossom that is severed from the root and tree on which
       it grows. Save the country, that you may continue to adorn
       it&mdash;save the crown, which is threatened with
       irreparable injury&mdash;save the aristocracy, which is
       surrounded with danger&mdash;save the altar, which is no
       longer safe when its kindred throne is shaken. You see that
       when the church and the throne would allow of no church
       solemnity in behalf of the Queen, the heartfelt prayers of
       the people rose to heaven for her protection. I pray heaven
       for her; and I here pour forth my fervent supplications at
       the throne of mercy, that mercies may descend on the people
       of this country richer than their rulers have deserved; and
       that your hearts may be turned to justice."</p>

    <p>The result need scarcely be alluded to. Men of all parties,
    however discordant might be their opinions upon the point at
    issue, acknowledged and admired the intrepidity and splendid
    talents of Mr. Brougham on this memorable occasion.</p>

    <p>Brilliant as has been the parliamentary career of Mr.
    Brougham from this period, our limits will allow us only to
    advert to a few of its brightest epochs. Whether advocating the
    rights and liberties, and a spirit of social improvement, at
    home, or aiding the progress of liberal opinion abroad, we find
    Mr. Brougham exercising the same uncompromising integrity and
    patriotic zeal. Spain, in 1823, became a fitting subject for
    his masterly eloquence. His remarks on the French government,
    on April 14, in the House of Commons, on the consideration of
    the policy observed by Great Britain in the affairs of France
    and Spain, will not soon be forgotten: "I do not," said Mr.
    Brougham, "identify the people of France with their government;
    for I believe that every wish of the French nation is in unison
    with those sentiments which animate the Spaniards. Neither does
    the army concur in this aggression; for the army alike detests
    the work of tyranny, plunder, cant, and hypocrisy. The war is
    not commenced because the people or the army require it, but
    because three or four French emigrants have obtained possession
    of power. It is for such miserable objects as these that the
    Spaniards are to be punished, because they have dared to
    vindicate their rights as a free and independent people. I hope
    to God that the Spaniards may succeed in the noble and
    righteous cause in which they are engaged."</p>

    <p>In 1824, (June 1), we find Mr. Brougham in the House of
    Commons, moving an address to the King, relative to the
    proceedings at Demerara against Smith, the missionary; but,
    after a debate of two days, the motion was
    negatived.<a id="footnotetag2"
       name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

    <p>During the period of Mr. Canning's ministry, his liberality
    gained Mr. Brougham's support: this is the only instance of Mr.
    Brougham's not being opposed to the minister of the day; and,
    observes a political writer, "he has been as much above the
    task of drudging for a party as drudging for a ministry."</p>

    <p>The year 1828 is a memorable one in Mr. Brougham's
    parliamentary life. Early in the session, upon the debate of
    the battle of Navarino, we find him expressing his readiness to
    support the ministry as long as the members who composed it
    showed a determination to retrench the expenditure of the
    country, to improve its domestic arrangements, and to adopt a
    truly British system of foreign policy. It was on this occasion
    that Mr. Brougham used the expression which has since become so
    familiar&mdash;"The schoolmaster is abroad." On Feb. 7, Mr.
    Brougham brought forward a motion on the State of the Law, in
    an elaborate speech of six hours delivery. The debate was
    adjourned to February 29, when Mr. Brougham's motion, in an
    amended shape, was put and agreed to, requesting the King to
    cause "due inquiry to be made into the origin, progress, and
    termination of actions in the superior courts of common law in
    this country;" and "into the state of the law regarding the
    transfer of real property." Even the heads of this speech would
    occupy one of our <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageix"
       id="pageix"></a>[pg ix]</span> pages. A passage much quoted
       at the time of its publication is a good specimen of Mr.
       Brougham's forcible style of illustration: "He was guilty of
       no error&mdash;he was chargeable with no
       exaggeration&mdash;he was betrayed by his fancy into no
       metaphor, who once said, that all we can see about us, King,
       Lords, and Commons, the whole machinery of the State, all
       the apparatus of the system and its varied workings, end
       simply in bringing twelve good men into a box." In the same
       month, Mr. Brougham spoke at great length in support of Lord
       John Russell's motion for the repeal of the Test and
       Corporation Acts. On March 6, Mr. Brougham spoke in support
       of Mr. Peel's motion for Catholic Emancipation, which he
       described as going "the full length that any reasonable man
       ever did or ever can demand; it does equal justice to his
       Majesty's Roman Catholic subjects; it puts an end to all
       religious distinctions; it exterminates all civil
       disqualifications on account of religious belief. It is
       simple and efficacious; clogged with no exceptions, unless
       such as even the most zealous of the Catholics themselves
       must admit to be of necessity parcel of the measure."</p>

    <p>In the session of 1829, Mr. Brougham explained the
    proceedings of the Commissioners appointed to inquire into
    Public Charities, who, it appeared, had examined sixteen
    counties, and partially examined ten; altogether amounting to
    more than 19,000 charities, being more than half the number in
    the whole kingdom.</p>

    <p>In 1830, Mr. Brougham supported Lord John Russell's plan for
    Parliamentary Reform, as an amendment to a motion of Mr.
    O'Connell; in which Mr. Brougham opposed universal suffrage and
    vote by ballot. In the same week also, he spoke at some length
    on the punishment of Forgery by death. The opinions which he
    expressed, Mr. Brougham said, he had learned from his great and
    lamented friend, Sir Samuel Romilly; and he concluded by
    expressing his hope that he should live to see the day when
    this stain should be removed from our statute-book. In the
    following month Mr. Brougham brought in a bill for local
    jurisdictions in England, for diminishing the expense of legal
    proceedings. On June 24, Mr. Brougham spoke at great length
    upon the inadequacy of the ministerial bill for the reform of
    the Court of Chancery. On July 13, he moved for the abolition
    of West India Slavery, and expatiated at great length and with
    extreme earnestness&mdash;first, on the right of the mother
    country to legislate for the colonies, and next on the legal
    and moral nature of slavery.</p>

    <p>Upon the dissolution of parliament, consequent upon the
    death of George IV., Mr. Brougham was invited to the
    representation of the extensive and wealthy county of York. In
    his speech to the electors he alluded to Parliamentary Reform,
    a revision of the Corn Laws, and the extinction of Colonial
    Slavery, as three grand objects of his ambition; and concluded
    by thus explaining his becoming a candidate&mdash;"<i>because
    it would arm him with an extraordinary and a vast and important
    accession of power to serve the people of England</i>." It need
    scarcely be added, that his election was secured; his return
    was free of all expense: indeed, never was triumph more
    complete.<a id="footnotetag3"
       name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

    <p>Soon after the assembling of the new parliament, Mr.
    Brougham, in connexion with the topic of the recent revolutions
    on the continent, and parliamentary reform in this country,
    concluded an interesting debate by saying&mdash;"He was for
    reform&mdash;for preserving, not for pulling down&mdash;for
    restoration, not for revolution. He was a shallow politician, a
    miserable reasoner, and he thought no very trustworthy man, who
    argued, that because the people of Paris had justifiably and
    gloriously resisted lawless oppression, the people of London
    and Dublin ought to rise for reform. Devoted as he was to the
    cause of parliamentary reform, he did not consider that the
    refusal of that benefit, or, he would say, that right, to the
    people of this country (if it were a legal
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="pagex"
       id="pagex"></a>[pg x]</span> refusal by King, Lords, and
       Commons, which he hoped to God would not take place) would
       be in the slightest degree a parallel case to any thing
       which had happened in France."</p>

    <p>Mr. Brougham's elevation to the exalted station which he now
    fills need be related but briefly, since the particulars must
    be fresh in the recollection of our readers. Upon the
    resignation of the Wellington ministry&mdash;with the title of
    BARON BROUGHAM AND VAUX, he took the oaths as Lord Chancellor,
    November 22, and his seat in the Chancery Court on November 25,
    1830.</p>

    <p>In the House of Lords, in reply to some censurable
    observations on his acceptance of office which had been made
    elsewhere, his lordship explained his motives with great
    candour. After an allusion to his difficulty in resigning his
    high station as a representative for Yorkshire, Lord Brougham
    said, "I need not add, that in changing my station in
    parliament, the principles which have ever guided me remain
    unchanged. When I accepted the high office to which I have been
    called, I did so in the full and perfect conviction, that far
    from disabling me to discharge my duty to my country&mdash;far
    from rendering my services less efficient, it but enlarged the
    sphere of my utility. The thing which dazzled me most in the
    prospect which opened to my view, was not the gewgaw splendour
    of the place, but because it seemed to afford me, if I were
    honest&mdash;on which I could rely; if I were
    consistent&mdash;which I knew to be matter of absolute
    necessity in my nature; and if I were as able as I knew myself
    honest and consistent&mdash;a field of exertion more extended.
    That by which the Great Seal dazzled my eyes, and induced me to
    quit a station which till this time I deemed the most proud
    which an Englishman could enjoy, was, that it seemed to hold
    out the gratifying prospect that in serving my king I should be
    better able to serve my country."</p>

    <p>Already has the official elevation of Lord Brougham been
    attended with manifest advantages, and promises of still
    greater benefits to the nation. Only such as are accustomed to
    the cares of office can form but a faint idea of the
    perplexities which beset the Lord Chancellor on the recent
    dissolution of parliament; yet in this arduous scene Lord
    Brougham is believed by all but the bitterest of his political
    opponents, to have comported himself with becoming equanimity.
    A political contemporary observes, upon his recent
    appointment&mdash;"There is no instance in modern times of an
    elevation marked with the same characters. Lord Brougham had
    never before been in office; he had passed through none of the
    degrees which for the most part, lead to the proud eminence
    where he now stands. We have had learned Chancellors, and
    political&mdash;or, we would rather say, politic
    Chancellors&mdash;but never before Lord Brougham (with,
    perhaps, the exception of Erskine), have we had what may be
    justly called a popular Chancellor. * * The consideration which
    he disdained to accept from party or from power in the House,
    his conduct has won from the great mass of his countrymen out
    of it. We speak the plain and simple truth when we
    say&mdash;and that not for the first time&mdash;that at no
    period of our history since the era of the Commonwealth has any
    one Englishman contrived to fix so many eyes upon him as Lord
    Brougham has for the last few years."<a id="footnotetag4"
       name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

    <p>Of Lord Brougham's qualifications as a barrister we have
    already spoken. To the hearing of appeals in the House of
    Lords, an important section of the public business, his
    Lordship brings qualifications not possessed by any of his
    predecessors. Seven years' practice at the Scotch bar, and a
    very extensive employment in appeals from that country (for he
    has been engaged in almost every case of importance for the
    last ten years) have made him familiar with the machinery of
    the law on which his decisions bear; and he therefore
    undertakes his judicial task with professional confidence.</p>

    <p>Besides contributing to the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, as we
    have noticed, Lord Brougham is the author of several papers in
    <i>Nicholson's Journal</i>, and in the Transactions of the
    Royal Society, of which his Lordship is a distinguished
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexi"
       id="pagexi"></a>[pg xi]</span> member. The chief entire work
       which bears his name is entitled, "An Inquiry into the
       Colonial Policy of the European States," 2 vols. 8vo. 1828;
       and a masterly pamphlet "On the State of the Nation," which
       has run through many editions. Several of his speeches have
       likewise been published.</p>

    <p>It is, however, in connexion with <i>Public Education</i>,
    that the pen of Lord Brougham has been more extensively
    employed. His zealous co-operation with Dr. Birkbeck, and other
    patriotic men of talent, in the establishment of Mechanics'
    Institutions in the year 1824, must be gratefully remembered by
    thousands who have enjoyed their benefits; and, for the
    advantage of the London Mechanics' Institution, were
    republished from the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, his excellent
    "<i>Practical Observations upon the Education of the
    People</i>, addressed to the Working Classes and their
    Employers."&mdash;The twentieth edition of this pamphlet is now
    before us, and from its conclusion, to show the practical
    utility of the author's suggestions, we quote the
    following:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"I rejoice to think that it is not necessary to close these
    observations by combating objections to the diffusion of
    science among the working classes, arising from considerations
    of a political nature. Happily the time is past and gone when
    bigots could persuade mankind that the lights of philosophy
    were to be extinguished as dangerous to religion; and when
    tyrants could proscribe the instructors of the people as
    enemies to their power. It is preposterous to imagine that the
    enlargement of our acquaintance with the laws which regulate
    the universe, can dispose to unbelief. It may be a cure for
    superstition&mdash;for intolerance it will be the most certain
    cure; but a pure and true religion has nothing to fear from the
    greatest expansion which the understanding can receive by the
    study either of matter or of mind. The more widely science is
    diffused, the better will the Author of all things be known,
    and the less will the people be 'tossed to and fro by the
    sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in
    wait to deceive.' To tyrants, indeed, and bad rulers, the
    progress of knowledge among the mass of mankind is a just
    object of terror: it is fatal to them and their designs; they
    know this by unerring instinct, and unceasingly they dread the
    light. But they will find it more easy to curse than to
    extinguish. It is spreading in spite of them, even in those
    countries where arbitrary power deems itself most secure; and
    in England, any attempt to check its progress would only bring
    about the sudden destruction of him who should be insane enough
    to make it.</p>

    <p>"To the Upper Classes of society, then, I would say, that
    the question no longer is whether or not the people shall be
    instructed&mdash;for that has been determined long ago, and the
    decision is irreversible&mdash;but whether they shall be well
    or ill taught&mdash;half informed or as thoroughly as their
    circumstances permit and their wants require. Let no one be
    afraid of the bulk of the community becoming too accomplished
    for their superiors. Well educated, and even well versed in the
    most elevated sciences, they assuredly may become; and the
    worst consequence that can follow to their superiors will be,
    that to deserve being called their <i>betters</i>, they too
    must devote themselves more to the pursuit of solid and refined
    learning; the present public seminaries must be enlarged: and
    some of the greater cities of the kingdom, especially the
    metropolis, must not be left destitute of the regular means
    within themselves of scientific education.</p>

    <p>"To the Working Classes I would say, that this is the time
    when by a great effort they may secure for ever the inestimable
    blessing of knowledge. Never was the disposition more universal
    among the rich to lend the requisite assistance for setting in
    motion the great engines of instruction; but the people must
    come forward to profit by the opportunity thus afforded, and
    they must themselves continue the movement once begun. Those
    who have already started in the pursuit of science, and tasted
    its sweets, require no exhortation to persevere; but if these
    pages should fall into the hands of any one at an hour for the
    first time stolen from his needful rest after his day's work is
    done, I ask of him to reward me (who have written them for
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexii"
       id="pagexii"></a>[pg xii]</span> his benefit at the like
       hours) by saving threepence during the next fortnight,
       buying with it Franklin's Life, and reading the first page.
       I am quite sure he will read the rest; I am almost quite
       sure he will resolve to spend his spare time and money, in
       gaining those kinds of knowledge which from a printer's boy
       made that great man the first philosopher, and one of the
       first statesmen of his age. Few are fitted by nature to go
       as far as he did, and it is not necessary to lead so
       perfectly abstemious a life, and to be so rigidly saving of
       every instant of time. But all may go a good way after him,
       both in temperance, industry, and knowledge, and no one can
       tell before he tries how near he may be able to approach
       him."</p>

    <p>We may here mention that in 1825, Lord Brougham was elected
    Lord Rector of the University of Glasgow; his opponent, Sir
    Walter Scott, lost the election by the casting vote of Sir
    James Mackintosh, in favour of Lord Brougham.</p>

    <p>Among the originators of the London University, Lord
    Brougham occupies a foremost rank, and partly by the aid of his
    indefatigable talents, that establishment was opened, in 1828,
    within seventeen months from the day on which the first stone
    was laid.</p>

    <p>Early in the year 1827 was established "the Society for the
    Diffusion of Useful Knowledge," of which Lord Brougham became,
    and continues to this day, chairman. In the original
    prospectus, issued under his sanction, we find "The object of
    the Society is strictly limited to what its title imports,
    namely, the imparting useful information to all classes of the
    community, particularly to such as are unable to avail
    themselves of experienced teachers, or may prefer learning by
    themselves." The Society commenced their labours by a set of
    Treatises, the first or "Preliminary Treatise," "<i>On the
    objects, pleasures, and advantages of Science</i>," being from
    the pen of Lord Brougham; and in perspicuity and popular
    interest, this treatise is unrivalled in our times. His
    Lordship is also understood, in conjunction with Mr. Charles
    Bell, to be engaged in illustrating with notes an edition of
    Paley's works, to be published by the above Society.</p>

    <p>In the preceding outline of the political life of Lord
    Brougham, we have quoted but few points of his personal
    character. This has been so well drawn, and so recently too,
    that we are induced to adopt the following traits from a
    contemporary Magazine.<a id="footnotetag5"
       name="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a>
       The paper whence these are extracted, purports to be a
       description of the Lord Chancellor's first levee:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Unfeigned respect for, and a slight personal acquaintance
    with, the noble person who now holds the seals, led me to
    attend his last levee. The practice of receiving the respects
    of the public on one or two stated occasions is sufficiently
    ancient, but I have understood was discontinued, or not much
    observed, in the latter days of Lord Eldon. It was revived with
    somewhat greater splendour by Lord Lyndhurst, but still it
    attracted little public notice. I incline to think that it was
    reserved for Brougham to illustrate the ancient custom, by the
    splendour of those who chose to be dutiful to the Lord
    Chancellor. The fashion of going to court is such, that it
    infers little personal respect to the individual monarch; but
    the practice of attending the levee of an inferior personage is
    to be ascribed to the respect which individual eminence
    commands. When Lord Brougham announced his levees, it could not
    be known whether he should receive the homage of the
    aristocracy, to whom it was not supposed that his lordship's
    politics were very amicable. It was moreover thought that the
    republican, or, to speak more guardedly, the whig Lord
    Chancellor would care little for a custom in which there was no
    manifest utility. He had declared that the gewgaws of office
    delighted him not; and I dare say he would fain bring his mind
    to believe that all ceremonial was idle, perhaps contemptible.
    But it is the greatest mistake to suppose that Lord Brougham is
    inattentive to the ceremonies with which his high place is
    surrounded. A careful observer will see clearly that imposing
    forms are <span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexiii"
       id="pagexiii"></a>[pg xiii]</span> perfectly agreeable to
       his mind; nobody could ridicule form better, so long as he
       held no situation which required the observance of customary
       rules; but elevated to his present distinction, it is plain
       that he enjoys all the little peculiarities of his office.
       Somebody said that he presided in the House of Lords in a
       bar whig, and instanced the fact as a proof of his reforming
       temper; but it was not true. Accident may have obliged him
       to take his seat in this ungainly form, but he had no
       purpose of deviating from the ancient full-bottom, and he is
       now to be seen in all the amplitude of the olden fleece. In
       like manner he observes the strict <i>regime</i>, so
       fantastical to a stranger, of causing counsel to be shouted
       for from without, although they are actually present; and he
       adds to the oddness of this custom by receiving them with a
       most imposing mien, and putting on his chapeau as they
       advance. This is a form, for which the model is not to be
       found in the practice of his immediate predecessors. It is
       possible, however, that his extensive and minute reading may
       have made him aware that Wolsey, peradventure, or some great
       chancellor of old, had the fancy to be covered when the
       suppliants approached. Let any one observe with what studied
       dignity he performs the duty of announcing the royal assent
       to Acts of Parliament: he assumes a solemnity of tone for
       which his voice is not ill-fitted, but which is unusual with
       him. These small circumstances, and many such which might be
       mentioned, show that State is not uncongenial to his mind.
       Why should it? His weakness consists in the unreal contempt
       for what is not really contemptible. With his high notions
       of office, I should have been surprised if he had foregone
       the levee; and assuredly he has not reckoned without reason;
       for a more splendid or flattering pageant could not be
       witnessed than that which his rooms exhibited.
       Unquestionably the most remarkable man in the empire at this
       moment, it is his fortune to attract the honourable regards
       of all who are distinguished as compeers. It is not my
       intention to offer any estimate of what I conceive to be his
       genuine worth, as he may be appreciated in a more
       dispassionate time; I speak of him only as a great man
       filling a very large space in the consideration of the
       empire. Judging from the throng of all classes upon this
       occasion, whose favour is desirable, no man is more popular
       * * *. The Chancellor took his place at a corner of the
       room, backed by his chaplain, and was soon encircled by the
       visitants; his dress remarkably plain, being a simple suit
       of velvet in the court cut. The names were announced from
       the bottom of the stairs, and each person as he entered
       walked up to the Chancellor and offered his respects. The
       numbers were so great that it was impossible to devote any
       marked attention to each; as soon, therefore, as the visiter
       had made his bow, he retired into the throng, or took his
       departure through the adjoining room. I was not present at
       the first of the levees which were held, and at which the
       attendance was very distinguished; but a friend who was,
       spoke very highly of the manner in which the Chancellor
       performed his noviciate. The Archbishop of Canterbury came
       early, and was very kindly received: he was followed by the
       Archbishop of York, and several other bishops, whose
       attendance gave proof that, differ as they might from Lord
       Brougham, they surely did not consider him an enemy to the
       Church * * *. The most remarkable visiter of that evening
       was the Duke of Wellington;&mdash;the crowd was astonished,
       and I dare say the Chancellor himself was surprised, when
       his name was sent up&mdash;I doubt if they had ever met in
       the same room before. Their political lives, with the
       exception of the Catholic Question, were one unvarying
       course of opposition, if not enmity. I suspect that for a
       time the Duke despised the talk of the lawyer; and, on the
       other hand, Brougham had often declared, that the respect
       which he entertained for military glory was not very lofty.
       Some of his bitterest tirades were levelled at the Duke
       personally. No one will deny that it was high-minded in the
       Duke to lay aside resentment of every sort, and offer this
       mark of respect as well to the man as the office. The
       Chancellor was flattered by the attention, and shook the
       Duke by the hand very cordially * * *. Not the least
       remarkable personage in the
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexiv"
       id="pagexiv"></a>[pg xiv]</span> room was the Lord Advocate
       of Scotland. Brougham and he are very old friends, and have
       been much engaged in the same species of literature.
       Brougham was his predecessor in the editorship of the
       Edinburgh Review&mdash;a fact which is not generally known,
       but which is certain. Brougham was not the first editor,
       having filled that office for a short time after Sidney
       Smith withdrew from the situation. Jeffrey appeared
       extremely <i>petit</i> in his court-dress, and did not seem
       very much at home: he was acquainted with but few of his
       fellow visiters, and had too much good taste to occupy much
       of the Chancellor's attention: they did not seem to hold any
       conversation beyond the usual common-place inquiries * * *.
       After I had paid my respects to the Chancellor, there came
       tripping up the Marquess of Bristol, with a springy step,
       which he must surely have acquired at the old court of
       France; for I am sure that no such movement could be
       attained on English ground. The elasticity of this noble
       lord was such, that when once put in motion, he continued to
       spring up and down in the manner of the Chinese figures,
       which are hawked by the Italian toy-venders. Had I been told
       that the head of the house of Newry was a dancing-master,
       who had not yet learned the present modes, I should
       certainly have believed the story without scruple, if I had
       met him anywhere else. He had no sooner left the Chancellor,
       than he was laid hold of by a fidgetty solicitor, who was
       the only member of his class in the room, and who, I
       understand, is a sort of favourite of the Chancellor. The
       obsequious grin, and the affected ease of this worthy, do
       not convey any very favourable impression on his behalf. He
       was solicitor for the Queen, and in this capacity formed an
       intimacy with her chief counsel, which an ill-natured person
       would perhaps think makes him now forget in some measure the
       great disparity betwixt their present condition. The
       Chancellor gave no discouragement to his familiarity * * *.
       A variety of lords, squires, generals, <i>ossa
       innominata</i> followed, for whom the Chancellor cared
       perhaps about as much as I did. At length Sir James Scarlett
       was announced, and the Chancellor left his place to meet
       him. His welcome was very hearty. Brougham was doubtless
       gratified by this token of respect from a man who was
       indisputably his leader in the courts, and for whose
       forensic abilities it is known, that he entertains, and has
       often expressed, the highest admiration. The position of the
       two men was singular, and to the ex-attorney not very
       enviable. Scarlett was in high practice before Brougham was
       even called to the bar. He kept a head of him in their
       profession throughout; and twice he had filled the first
       places at the bar, when the respective attainments of these
       eminent persons were such, that if Brougham had been placed
       before him, Scarlett would have had just ground of
       complaint; and the bar would have unanimously decried the
       appointment. Now, however, by one of those cross accidents
       which will occur in the most fortunate lives, Scarlett was,
       with strict justice and universal acquiescence, placed below
       his former competitor, and in direct opposition to all the
       early friends with whom he commenced his political career.
       It was matter of necessity and of course that he should go
       out when his employers were obliged to surrender office; and
       no man could complain that Brougham should then be elevated
       to a distinction, which in other circumstances Scarlett
       might have thought his own by indisputable right * * *. The
       Speaker of the House of Commons was then announced. Brougham
       and he met as warm friends, though certainly men having
       little in kindred. In point of talent there is no ground of
       comparison; yet it may be doubted whether they are not
       nearly as great in their own way. I have no notion of the
       place which the Speaker held in parliament before he was
       elected to the chair, and I know few situations which
       require more tact and management. In these qualifications
       the present Speaker is signally gifted. He brings a degree
       of good nature to the office, which no event, however
       untoward, can ruffle;&mdash;his calmness never forsakes him:
       he is the same easy, dignified chairman at all times. The
       Commons are a truly turbulent body, but they are not
       impatient of his sway. In all emergencies he is vigorously
       supported: <span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexv"
       id="pagexv"></a>[pg xv]</span> in his hands, the authority
       of his office, though rarely exercised, has lost none of its
       force. Brougham himself was one of the most fiery spirits in
       this hot region; but a word from the Speaker would calm him
       in an instant. Among other qualifications for command, he is
       possessed of a fine mellow, deep-toned voice, which, while
       it powerfully enunciates the "Order," frees the command from
       all harshness or severity. As the first commoner in the
       land, and a truly estimable gentleman, he was entitled to be
       well received * * *. The last person of note who arrived
       before I departed was Sir Thomas Denman. The Chancellor was
       engaged with some one at the moment, and nothing passed
       betwixt them but an exchange of bows. It was nearly ten
       years since I had seen Brougham and Denman together; the
       Queen's trial was then the all-engrossing topic of public
       consideration. Who could then have foretold that these men
       would have in so short a space won the confidence of a
       sovereign, whom they attacked with a degree of virulence
       which, even in those days of party violence, was generally
       condemned? The change in feeling is creditable alike to
       all."</p>

    <p>Of the eloquence and general character of Lord Brougham, we
    have the following excellent portraiture by a
    master-hand:<a id="footnotetag6"
       name="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Mr. Brougham is from the North of England, but he was
    educated in Edinburgh, and represents that school of politics
    and political economy in the house. He differs from Sir James
    Mackintosh in this, that he deals less in abstract principles,
    and more in individual details. He makes less use of general
    topics, and more of immediate facts. Sir James is better
    acquainted with the balance of an argument in old authors; Mr.
    Brougham with the balance of power in Europe. If the first is
    better versed in the progress of history, no man excels the
    last in a knowledge of the course of exchange. He is apprized
    of the exact state of our exports and imports, and scarce a
    ship clears out its cargo at Liverpool or Hull, but he has
    notice of the bill of lading. Our colonial policy, prison
    discipline, the state of the hulks, agricultural distress,
    commerce and manufactures, the bullion question, the Catholic
    Question, the Bourbons or the Inquisition, 'domestic treason,
    foreign levy,' nothing can come amiss to him&mdash;he is at
    home in the crooked mazes of rotten boroughs, is not baffled by
    Scotch law, and can follow the meaning of one of Mr. Canning's
    speeches. With so many resources, with such variety and
    solidity of information, Mr. Brougham is rather a powerful and
    alarming, than an effectual debater. In so many details (which
    he himself goes through with unwearied and unshrinking
    resolution) the spirit of the question is lost to others who
    have not the same voluntary power of attention or the same
    interest in hearing that he has in speaking; the original
    impulse that urged him forward is forgotten in so wide a field,
    in so interminable a career. If he can, others <i>cannot</i>
    carry all he knows in their heads at the same time; a rope of
    circumstantial evidence does not hold well together, nor drag
    the unwilling mind along with it (the willing mind hurries on
    before it, and grows impatient and absent)&mdash;he moves in an
    unmanageable procession of facts and proofs, instead of coming
    to the point at once&mdash;and his premises (so anxious is he
    to proceed on sure and ample grounds) overlay and block up his
    conclusion, so that you cannot arrive at it, or not till the
    first fury and shock of the onset is over. The ball, from the
    too great width of the <i>calibre</i> from which it is sent,
    and from striking against such a number of hard, projecting
    points, is almost spent before it reaches its destination. He
    keeps a ledger or a debtor-and-creditor account between the
    government and the country, posts so much actual crime,
    corruption, and injustice against so much contingent advantage
    or sluggish prejudice, and at the bottom of the page brings in
    the balance of indignation and contempt, where it is due. But
    people are not to be <i>calculated into</i> contempt or
    indignation on abstract grounds; for however they may submit to
    this process where their own interests are concerned, in what
    regards the public good we believe they must see and feel
    instinctively, or not at all.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexvi"
       id="pagexvi"></a>[pg xvi]</span> There is (it is to be
       lamented) a good deal of froth as well as strength in the
       popular spirit, which will not admit of being
       <i>decanted</i> or served out in formal driblets; nor will
       spleen (the soul of opposition) bear to be corked up in
       square patent bottles, and kept for future use!</p>

    <p>"Mr. Brougham speaks in a loud and unmitigated tone of
    voice, sometimes almost approaching to a scream. He is fluent,
    rapid, vehement, full of his subject, with evidently a great
    deal to say, and very regardless of the manner of saying it. As
    a lawyer, he has not hitherto been remarkably successful. He is
    not profound in cases and reports, nor does he take much
    interest in the peculiar features of a particular cause, or
    show much adroitness in the management of it. He carries too
    much weight of metal for ordinary and petty occasions: he must
    have a pretty large question to discuss, and must make
    <i>thorough-stitch</i> work of it. Mr. Brougham writes almost,
    if not quite, as well as he speaks. In the midst of an election
    contest he comes out to address the populace, and goes back to
    his study to finish an article for the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>,
    sometimes indeed wedging three or four articles (in the shape
    of <i>refaccimentos</i> of his own pamphlets or speeches in
    parliament) into a single number. Such indeed is the activity
    of his mind that it appears to require neither repose, nor any
    other stimulus than a delight in its own exercise. He can turn
    his hand to any thing, but he cannot be idle. There are few
    intellectual accomplishments which he does not possess, and
    possess in a very high degree. He speaks French (and, we
    believe, several other modern languages) fluently: is a capital
    mathematician, and obtained an introduction to the celebrated
    Carnot in this latter character, when the conversation turned
    on squaring the circle, and not on the propriety of confining
    France within the natural boundary of the Rhine. Mr. Brougham
    is, in fact, a striking instance of the versatility and
    strength of the human mind, and also in one sense of the length
    of human life, if we make a good use of our time. There is room
    enough to crowd almost every art and science into it. If we
    pass 'no day without a line,' visit no place without the
    company of a book, we may with ease fill libraries or empty
    them of their contents. Those who complain of the shortness of
    life, let it slide by them without wishing to seize and make
    the most of its golden minutes. The more we do, the more we can
    do; the more busy we are, the more leisure we have. Mr.
    Brougham, among other means of strengthening and enlarging his
    views, has visited, we believe, most of the courts, and turned
    his attention to most of the constitutions of the continent. He
    is, no doubt, a very accomplished, active-minded, and admirable
    person."</p>

    <p>Lord Brougham married, in 1816, Mary Anne, relict of John
    Slade, Esq., of Hill street, Berkeley-square; by whom he has
    one daughter. Lady Brougham's maiden name was Eden: she is
    nearly related to the Auckland and Handley families. At her
    marriage with Mr. Slade, in 1808, she was accounted an
    extremely beautiful young woman; and she was still possessed of
    great personal charms at the period of her second union. Lady
    Brougham had by her former marriage a son, who inherits his
    father's estate, and is an. officer in the army, and a
    daughter. Lady Brougham brought no property to her husband but
    her jointure of £1,500 a-year, and the house No. 5,
    Hill-street.</p>

    <p>Lord Brougham was born in 1779, and is, consequently, in his
    fifty-second year.</p>

        <p>We are aware of having already quoted these particulars,
        from the <i>Spectator</i> newspaper, at page 412 of the
        <i>Mirror</i>, vol. xvi. but their repetition here is
        essential to the completeness of the present Memoir. Of
        Lord Brougham's family, in connexion with Brougham Castle,
        in Westmoreland, there were many conflicting statements at
        the period of his lordship's elevation to the peerage
        towards the close of last year. The Chancellor is said to
        have had a latent claim as heir-general to the Barony of
        Vaux, (whose arms are to be seen on the tower of Brougham
        Castle,) and hence his creation by that title. Some
        exclusive information, obligingly furnished, (at the
        Chancellor's request, in reply to our application) by a
        relative of his lordship, will also be found at length in
        the <i>Mirror</i>, vol. xvi. but for the reader's
        convenience we quote its substance: "Before the time of the
        Norman Conquest, the manor and lordship of Brougham (then
        called Burgham) were held by the Saxon family of de
        Burgham, from whom the Lord Chancellor is lineally
        descended. After the Conquest, William the Norman granted
        to Robert de Veteripont, or Vipont, extensive rights and
        territories in Westmoreland; and among others, some
        oppressive rights of seigniory over the manor of Brougham,
        then held by Walter de Burgham. To relieve the estate of
        such services, Gilbert de Burgham, in the reign of King
        John, agreed to give up absolutely one-third part of his
        estate to Robert de Veteripont, and also the advowson of
        the rectory of Brougham. This third comprises the land upon
        which the castle is built, and the estate afterwards given
        by Anne Countess of Pembroke, (heiress of Veteripont,) to
        the Hospital of Poor Widows at Appleby. Brougham Castle, if
        not built, was much extended by Veteripont; and afterwards
        still more enlarged by Roger Clifford, who succeeded, by
        marriage, to the Veteripont possessions. The manor house,
        about three quarters of a mile from the castle, continued
        in the Brougham family; and part of it, especially the
        gateway, is supposed to be of Saxon architecture: at all
        events, it is the earliest Norman. The chapel is also old,
        except the roof, which was renewed in the year 1659. In the
        year 1607, Thomas Brougham, then Lord of the Manor of
        Brougham, died without issue male, and the estate was sold
        to one Bird, who was steward of the Clifford family; the
        heir male of the Brougham family then residing at Scales
        Hall, in Cumberland. About 1680, John Brougham of Scales,
        re-purchased the estate and manor of Brougham from Bird's
        grandson and entailed it on his nephew, from whom it passed
        by succession to the Lord Chancellor."</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
